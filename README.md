# The Fourth Idea
An Adventure-Essay
by pladams9

The Fourth Idea is an interactive fiction - a text adventure - created for Ludum Dare 41. Ludum Dare is a (casual) competition where participants try to create an entire game by themselves and entirely within 48 hours.

The theme for Ludum Dare 41 was "Combine 2 Incompatible Genres." Since I had already decided on using Inform 7 to create an interactive fiction, I chose two *literary* genres - Adventure (which encompasses a large portion of IF) and Essay. I dug out my books looking for something and found Richard Jeffries' spiritual autobiography "The Story of My Heart." It's not exactly essay, but it was a great mixture of concrete nature images and abstract mystical ideas. The theme's just a guideline anyway, right?

I'm not sure if my (heavy) use of passages from Richard Jeffries' book will disqualify me from the competition, but it is in the public domain, and I would argue that the way I have split up, arranged, and supplemented these passages constitutes a derivative work.

Anyway, I had fun, and here it is.
