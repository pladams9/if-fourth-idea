Some warrior had been interred there in the antehistoric times. The sun of the summer morning shone on the dome of sward, and the air came softly up from the wheat below, the tips of the grasses swayed as it passed sighing faintly, it ceased, and the bees hummed by to the thyme and heathbells. I became absorbed in the glory of the day, the sunshine, the sweet air, the yellowing corn turning from its sappy green to summer's noon of gold, the lark's song like a waterfall in the sky. I felt at that moment that I was like the spirit of the man whose body was interred in the tumulus; I could understand and feel his existence the same as my own. He was as real to me two thousand years after interment as those I had seen in the body. The abstract personality of the dead seemed as existent as thought. As my thought could slip back the twenty centuries in a moment to the forest-days when he hurled the spear, or shot with the bow, hunting the deer, and could return again as swiftly to this moment, so his spirit could endure from then till now, and the time was nothing.[</span><span class="substitution">paragraph break</span><span class="quote">][</span><span class="substitution">roman type</span><span class="quote">][</span><span class="substitution">end if</span><span class="quote">]You are on a hilltop inhabited only by an ancient warrior in his burial mound.[</span><span class="substitution">paragraph break</span><span class="quote">]A small wood can be seen in the distance to the west.[</span><span class="substitution">line break</span><span class="quote">]A brook lies down the hill to the south.[</span><span class="substitution">if wall hole is open</span><span class="quote">][</span><span class="substitution">line break</span><span class="quote">]There is a hole leading into the burial mound.</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">The tumulus is in TumulusHill. &quot;<span class="quote">[</span><span class="substitution">if we have not examined the tumulus</span><span class="quote">][</span><span class="substitution">italic type</span><span class="quote">]Sweetly the summer air came up to the tumulus, the grass sighed softly, the butterflies went by, sometimes alighting on the green dome. Two thousand years! Summer after summer the blue butterflies had visited the mound, the thyme had flowered, the wind sighed in the grass. The azure morning had spread its arms over the low tomb; and full glowing noon burned on it; the purple of sunset rosied the sward. Stars, ruddy in the vapour of the southern horizon, beamed at midnight through the mystic summer night, which is dusky and yet full of light. White mists swept up and hid it; dews rested on the turf; tender harebells drooped; the wings of the finches fanned the air—finches whose colours faded from the wings how many centuries ago! Two thousand times! Two thousand times the woods grew green, and ring-doves built their nests. Day and night for two thousand years—light and shadow sweeping over the mound—two thousand years of labour by day and slumber by night. Mystery gleaming in the stars, pouring down in the sunshine, speaking in the night, the wonder of the sun and of far space, for twenty centuries round about this low and green-grown dome. Yet all that mystery and wonder is as nothing to the Thought that lies therein, to the spirit that I feel so close.[</span><span class="substitution">paragraph break</span><span class="quote">][</span><span class="substitution">roman type</span><span class="quote">][</span><span class="substitution">end if</span><span class="quote">]It is a burial mound, covered in grass.
