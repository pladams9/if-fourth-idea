When all the stars have revolved they only produce Now again. The continuity of Now is for ever. So that it appears to me purely natural, and not super natural, that the soul whose temporary frame was interred in this mound should be existing as I sit on the sward. How infinitely deeper is thought than the million miles of the firmament! The wonder is here, not there; now, not to be, now always. Things that have been miscalled supernatural appear to me simple, more natural than nature, than earth, than sea, or sun. It is beyond telling more natural that I should have a soul than not, that there should be immortality; I think there is much more than immortality. It is matter which is the supernatural, and difficult of under-standing. Why this clod of earth I hold in my hand? Why this water which drops sparkling from my fingers dipped in the brook? Why are they at all? When? How? What for? Matter is beyond understanding, mysterious, impenetrable; I touch it easily, comprehend it, no. Soul, mind—the thought, the idea—is easily understood, it understands itself and is conscious.[</span><span class="substitution">paragraph break</span><span class="quote">][</span><span class="substitution">roman type</span><span class="quote">][</span><span class="substitution">end if</span><span class="quote">]You are inside of the hilltop burial mound.[</span><span class="substitution">paragraph break</span><span class="quote">]There is a hole in the wall of the mound letting in light and air from the outside.</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">There is a skeleton in Inside the Tumulus.</p><p class="indent0">The description of the skeleton is &quot;<span class="quote">[</span><span class="substitution">if we have not examined the skeleton</span><span class="quote">][</span><span class="substitution">italic type</span><span class="quote">]Two thousand years being a second to the soul could not cause its extinction. It was no longer to the soul than my thought occupied to me. Recognising my own inner consciousness, the psyche, so clearly, death did not seem to me to affect the personality. In dissolution there was no bridgeless chasm, no unfathomable gulf of separation; the spirit did not immediately become inaccessible, leaping at a bound to an immeasurable distance. Look at another person while living; the soul is not visible, only the body which it animates. Therefore, merely because after death the soul is not visible is no demonstration that it does not still live. The condition of being unseen is the same condition which occurs while the body is living, so that intrinsically there is nothing exceptionable, or supernatural, in the life of the soul after death. Resting by the tumulus, the spirit of the man who had been interred there was to me really alive, and very close. This was quite natural, as natural and simple as the grass waving in the wind, the bees humming, and the larks' songs. Only by the strongest effort of the mind could I understand the idea of extinction; that was supernatural, requiring a miracle; the immortality of the soul natural, like earth. Listening to the sighing of the grass I felt immortality as I felt the beauty of the summer morning, and I thought beyond immortality, of other conditions, more beautiful than existence, higher than immortality.[</span><span class="substitution">paragraph break</span><span class="quote">][</span><span class="substitution">roman type</span><span class="quote">][</span><span class="substitution">end if</span><span class="quote">]It is the skeleton of a long-dead warrior, buried within this tumulus - his body's final home.</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">Instead of taking skeleton, say &quot;<span class="quote">Leave him be - better that he continue here toward dissolution.</span>&quot; Understand &quot;<span class="quote">ancient warrior</span>&quot; as the skeleton.
