It is impossible to wrest the mind down to the same laws that rule pieces of timber, water, or earth. They do not control the soul, however rigidly they may bind matter. So full am I always of a sense of the immortality now at this moment round about me, that it would not surprise me in the least if a circumstance outside physical experience occurred. It would seem to me quite natural. Give the soul the power it conceives, and there would be nothing wonderful in it.</span>&quot;;</p><p class="indent2">now the ocean-turns-waited of the player is 1;</p><p class="indent1">otherwise if the ocean-turns-waited of the player is 1:</p><p class="indent2">say &quot;<span class="quote">[</span><span class="substitution">italic type</span><span class="quote">]I can see nothing astonishing in what are called miracles. Only those who are mesmerised by matter can find a difficulty in such events. I am aware that the evidence for miracles is logically and historically untrustworthy; I am not defending recorded miracles. My point is that in principle I see no reason at all why they should not take place this day. I do not even say that there are or ever have been miracles, but I maintain that they would be perfectly natural. The wonder rather is that they do not happen frequently. Consider the limitless conceptions of the soul: let it possess but the power to realise those conceptions for one hour, and how little, how trifling would be the helping of the injured or the sick to regain health and happiness—merely to think it. A soul-work would require but a thought. Soul-work is an expression better suited to my meaning than 'miracle,' a term like others into which a special sense has been infused.</span>&quot;;</p><p class="indent2">now the ocean-turns-waited of the player is 2;</p><p class="indent1">otherwise if the ocean-turns-waited of the player is greater than 1:</p><p class="indent2">say &quot;<span class="quote">Time and Self seem to slip away, and when they seem almost to be gone, a strip of land looms before you.
