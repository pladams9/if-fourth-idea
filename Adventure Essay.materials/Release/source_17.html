As commonly understood, a 'miracle' is a mere nothing. I can conceive soul-works done by simple will or thought a thousand times greater. I marvel that they do not happen this moment. The air, the sunlight, the night, all that surrounds me seems crowded with inexpressible powers, with the influence of Souls, or existences, so that I walk in the midst of immortal things. I myself am a living witness of it. Sometimes I have concentrated myself, and driven away by continued will all sense of outward appearances, looking straight with the full power of my mind inwards on myself. I find 'I' am there; an 'I' I do not wholly understand, or know—something is there distinct from earth and timber, from flesh and bones. Recognising it, I feel on the margin of a life unknown, very near, almost touching it: on the verge of powers which if I could grasp would give me an immense breadth of existence, an ability to execute what I now only conceive; most probably of far more than that. To see that 'I' is to know that I am surrounded with immortal things. If, when I die, that 'I' also dies, and becomes extinct, still even then I have had the exaltation of these ideas.[</span><span class="substitution">paragraph break</span><span class="quote">][</span><span class="substitution">roman type</span><span class="quote">][</span><span class="substitution">end if</span><span class="quote">]You are standing in a forest.
