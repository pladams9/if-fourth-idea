It is eternity now. I am in the midst of it. It is about me in the sunshine; I am in it, as the butterfly floats in the light-laden air. Nothing has to come; it is now. Now is eternity; now is the immortal life. Here this moment, by this tumulus, on earth, now; I exist in it. The years, the centuries, the cycles are absolutely nothing; it is only a moment since this tumulus was raised; in a thousand years it will still be only a moment. To the soul there is no past and no future; all is and will be ever, in now. For artificial purposes time is mutually agreed on, but is really no such thing. The shadow goes on upon the dial, the index moves round upon the clock, and what is the difference? None whatever. If the clock had never been set going, what would have been the difference? There may be time for the clock, the clock may make time for itself; there is none for me.[</span><span class="substitution">paragraph break</span><span class="quote">][</span><span class="substitution">roman type</span><span class="quote">]You seem to have lost all your possessions - the black orb being the only exception.[</span><span class="substitution">paragraph break</span><span class="quote">][</span><span class="substitution">end if</span><span class="quote">]You are on a hilltop nearly identical to the one which held the tumulus, but there is nothing here but grass and, surrounding the hill, forest.[</span><span class="substitution">paragraph break</span><span class="quote">]A path to the east leads down into the forest.</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">The hill-forest is scenery in Ancient Hilltop.
